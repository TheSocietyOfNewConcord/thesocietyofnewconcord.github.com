        <h2>Summer BBQ and Social</h2>
        <p>On an absolutely gorgeous Summer day, we had a successful Barbecue and Social on the grounds of Fran and Paul Vielette's Elliot Road compound, with about 40 people attending. The setting was spacious and appealing&ellips;at pond-side. Peter Newmand and Steve Anderson manned the grill for burgers and dogs; there were contributions of tasty side dishes and desserts. We were joined&mdash;after a meeting that ended late&mdash;by a contingent from the Red Rock Historical Society.</p>
        <p>We had such a good time that the event ran hours into the early evening.</p>

        <p>PS21 put on a special performance of their production of Thornton Wilder's <em>Our Town</em> last Thursday to benefit the Society of New Concord Buidling Fund. For this performance, the part of Professor Willard was played by Friend of New Concord, David Dashiell.</p>
        <p>New Concorcord was represented by about a dozen neighbors, who pronounced the performance moving and excellent.</p>
        <p>We are grateful to Judy Grunberg and PS21 for sharing their success with us.</p>

        <h2>Combined meeting of 'Executive Committee' and 'Fundraising Committee'</h2>
        <p>The combined SNC Executive Committe and Fundraising Committee met at the home of Ann and David Pearce on Sunday morning to work through plans for our upcoming fundraising effort. The members of both committees have all made pledges to demonstrate committment and good faith to the SNC membership. We have delineated plans for an effort that we hope and trust will raise $100,000 and allow us to purchase Church, Community Hall, and the land they sit on.</p>

        <h2>Clean Up New Concord Day</h2>
        <p>Our plan was to repeat the success of 'Clean Up New Concord Day' of April 2009, with cleanup routes to be covered: New Concord Road from its highest point down to Rt. 295, Country Route 9 from I-90 to Dewitt-Brown Road, and all of Elliot Road.</p>
        <p>Sadly, because of rain and impending storms, the cleanup did not take place.</p>
        <p>However, a brunch at the home of Sue and Steve Anderson--planned as a reward for the crews that participated in the cleanup--DID take place. It was well-attended, and there was lots of good food and conversation.</p>
        <p>A social&mdash;if not an environmental&mdash;success! Well be back next year for more cleanup.</p>

        <h2>Formation of a Fundraising Committee</h2>
        <p>The Society of New Concord Executive Committee has been working in the background for the past several months to explore the possibility of saving the Church building and adjacent Community Hall by purchasing them from the Dutch Reform Classis (governing body for Columbia County). Now that we have determined that it is feasible, we have appointed a fund-raising committed, and have had acceptances from: Daron Builta, Don Harwood, Mike Kelly, Peter Newman, David Pearce and Eileen Rice.</p>

        <h2>Historical Event: Medicine in the 18th Century New York</h2>
        <p>In a very well-attended meeting at the East Chatham Fire House, Stewart Lehman, in revolutionary dress, presented a fascinating discussion of medicine as it would have been approached (by physicians, barbers, herbalists, midwives and elders) in 18th Century Hudson Valley. The descriptions were interesting, amusing and occasionally grizzly. He and his wife held a well-used discussion session afterwards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehman had on display a large array of herbs, medicines, and implements, which the crowd examined.</p>
        <p>A traditional colonial period lunch was served, including Brunswick stew, baked desserts, and beverages.</p>
        <p>It was a unique and enjoyable session.</p>

        <h2>Annual Meeting and Coffee Hour</h2>
        <p>The meeting began at 11:00 in the East Chatham Fire House. There were approximately 30 members present. After a lively coffee hour, Steve Anderson chaired the session. He first introduced Nancy Williams, Treasurer, who gave an overview of income and expenses for the year.</p>
        <p>Steve then introduced Peter Newman for the events committee, who gave an overview of events of the past year, such as the tree lighting party, the Tag/Bake sale, the clean up New Concord Day, and the "Invasive plant species" talk. All events were successful except for the Tag/Bake sale. Future events planned are the Stew/Chowder historical presentation about Medicine in the 18th Century. Also planned for the Spring party is a Bake/Tag sale.</p>
        <p>Paul Veillette, Historian, talked about the progress of the possible purchase of the Dutch Reformed Church building in New Concord. Many questions were asked, primarily about the ability of the Society to pay for the purchase and the monthly expenses and upkeep of the buildings.</p>
        <p>Don Harwood gave a report on the application to have the hamlet of New Concord designated as a New York State Historic District. The designation will be purely honorific and will not place any burden on the home owners in the Hamlet.</p>
        <p>The membership voted on and approved the officers selected by the Board of Directors. A brief Executive Committee meeting was held at the end of the annual meeting to assign officers to their positions.</p>

        <p>Peter Newman and Kevin Weldon hosted a well-attended and very festive holiday party in thier home, before the assemblage moved to the green for the Tree Lighting; the tree has never looked so good [watch out, Rockefeller Center]. There was plenty of food and drink, excellent hospitality, warm fires, carol singing, and lots and lots of talking.</p>

        <p>The Tag and Bake sale was held (mostly) on the Hamlet Green this past weekend. Although lots of energy was expended on the effort, the turnour was smaller than for previous events. Nonetheless, many of those who took part had a good time.</p>

        <p>The weather unaccountably cooperated (i.e. it stopped raining for the first time in the month) for our summer picnic on the lawn and patios of Peter Newman and Kevin Weldon (New Concord Road). Lots of our members showed up to eat, drink, share and chat.</p>
        <p>Our feature was an informal and very informative lecture about "Invasive Species In Our Area" by Claudia Vispo, Botanist, Farmscape Ecology Program.</p>

        <h2>Clean Up New Concord Day</h2>
        <p>From 1:00 to about 4:00 this gray afternoon, we had a great turnout to clean up and recycle YEARS worth of litter from the roadsides of New Concord (County 9, New Concord Road, and Elliot Road). We certainly outdid any local chain gang! And we had more fun than the local penitentiary denizens, too.</p>
        <p>Big thanks to everybody who pitched in, and to the organizers.</p>
        <p>We hope to make this an annual event, and look forward to more beautification next year.</p>
